# breadth-first search is to keep track of visited cells and all your partial plans
# and always expand the shortest partial plan first

# now we add the notion of cost function. which is the total cost of all the actions in a partial plan
# this helps in expansion to optimize the search process for lowest cost
# note that by expanding by bringing next lowest cost node to the front of the queue before analyzing same
# level neighbours, we'll start analyzing next level before analyzing all current level nodes and hence loose
# shortest path
